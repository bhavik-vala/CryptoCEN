## Pitch Template (5 min Elevator)

```
"We've built an AI system that generates and posts 
professional LinkedIn content automatically every day.

Think of it like hiring a content team, but instead 
of paying $5000/month, it costs $300-2000.

We handle all the setup. You just configure your 
preferences once, and it runs on autopilot.

Most exchange clients see:
- 40-60% engagement boost
- 20+ new leads per month from LinkedIn
- 5-10 hours saved per week on content

Want to see a quick demo?"
