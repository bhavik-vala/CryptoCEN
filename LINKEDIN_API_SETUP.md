# LinkedIn API Setup

1. Create a LinkedIn app and obtain an access token with `w_member_social` scope.
2. Retrieve your member URN (person id). Use `urn:li:person:<id>` format; only the `<id>` is stored in `LINKEDIN_PERSON_ID`.
3. For Ayrshare or Buffer, follow their docs to obtain API keys and fill the `.env` fields.

Note: For non-technical users, Ayrshare simplifies posting — you can paste your post into their dashboard if API setup is difficult.
