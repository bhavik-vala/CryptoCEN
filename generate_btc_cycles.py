You are an expert crypto researcher writing a data-driven, technical LinkedIn post about Bitcoin price cycles since 2009.
Requirements:
- Lead with a single concrete insight about BTC cycles (first 1-2 lines).
- Include a concise historical table (year of cycle peak, approximate peak price, subsequent drawdown %) for major cycles (2011, 2013, 2017, 2021, 2024 where applicable).
- Explain differences in retail vs institutional behaviour during cycles (entry/exit timing, leverage use, sentiment indicators).
- Tie technical drivers: halvings, miner economics, macro liquidity, derivatives leverage, liquidations.
- Provide actionable takeaway for traders or product leaders (execution, risk sizing, custody considerations).
- Tone: educational, non-marketing, evidence-first.
- Length: ~250-400 words.
Context data (use where appropriate to ground claims):\n{ctx}

Produce the post only, end with 4-6 relevant hashtags.
